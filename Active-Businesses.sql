-- Table: Events

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |

-- | business_id   | int     |
-- | event_type    | varchar |
-- | occurences    | int     | 
-- +---------------+---------+
-- (business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
-- Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occured at some business for a number of times.
 

-- Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.

-- An active business is a business that has more than one event type with occurences greater than the average occurences of that event type among all businesses.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Events table:
-- +-------------+------------+------------+
-- | business_id | event_type | occurences |
-- +-------------+------------+------------+
-- | 1           | reviews    | 7          |
-- | 3           | reviews    | 3          |
-- | 1           | ads        | 11         |
-- | 2           | ads        | 7          |
-- | 3           | ads        | 6          |
-- | 1           | page views | 3          |
-- | 2           | page views | 12         |
-- +-------------+------------+------------+

-- Result table:
-- +-------------+
-- | business_id |
-- +-------------+
-- | 1           |
-- +-------------+ 
-- Average for 'reviews', 'ads' and 'page views' are (7+3)/2=5, (11+7+6)/3=8, (3+12)/2=7.5 respectively.
-- Business with id 1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8) so it is an active business.

-- Schema for Active-Businesses:

-- Create the Events table

CREATE TABLE Events (
    business_id INT,
    event_type VARCHAR(255),
    occurences INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (business_id, event_type)
);

-- Insert Sample Data

INSERT INTO Events (business_id, event_type, occurences) VALUES
(1, 'reviews', 7),
(3, 'reviews', 3),
(1, 'ads', 11),
(2, 'ads', 7),
(3, 'ads', 6),
(1, 'page views', 3),
(2, 'page views', 12);

-- Solution to Active-Businesses:
SELECT 
    t1.business_id
FROM
    Events AS t1
        JOIN
    (SELECT 
        event_type, AVG(occurences) AS avg_occur
    FROM
        Events
    GROUP BY event_type) AS t2 ON t1.event_type = t2.event_type
WHERE
    t1.occurences > t2.avg_occur
GROUP BY t1.business_id
HAVING COUNT(t1.event_type) > 1;

-- with cte:
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT event_type, AVG(occurences) AS avg_occur
FROM Events
GROUP BY event_type
),
cte2 AS (
SELECT e.business_id, e.event_type
FROM Events e
JOIN cte1 a
ON e.event_type = a.event_type
WHERE e.occurences > a.avg_occur
),
cte3 AS (
SELECT business_id
FROM cte2
GROUP BY business_id
HAVING COUNT(event_type) > 1
)
SELECT business_id
FROM cte3;
